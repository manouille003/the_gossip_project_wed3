************* Wednesday has come ***********

And I am still fighting with Ruby on Rails, trying to apply all knowledge shared in THP resources.

In the document, I have used the command 'scaffold', which is creating everything I needed to view, create, edit and delete gossips in my website.

I am now working on the display, because the view is very basic right now, and I want to make it looks more friendly.
